Memory allocation is mainly a computer hardware operation which is managed through operating system and software applications. Its process is pretty similar to the physical and virtual memory management. Programs and services are assigned with a specific memory as per their requirements when they are executed. Once the program has finished its operation or is idle, the memory is released and allocated to another program or merged within the primary memory.\\

Memory allocation has two core types:
\begin{itemize}
\item Static Memory Allocation: The program is allocated memory at compile time.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Dynamic Memory Allocation: The programs are allocated with memory at run time.
\end{itemize}

In this report, we will focus on the dynamic allocation of memory and its operation.

\subsection{Presentation of IRIF}
\textbf{Research Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science }
(IRIF) is a research unit co-founded by the CNRS and the University Paris-Diderot, as UMR 8243. IRIF hosts two INRIA project-teams. IRIF is also member of the Foundation of Mathematical Sciences of Paris (FSMP) and of the Federation of Research in Mathematics of Paris. \\

IRIF results from the merging of the two research units LIAFA and PPS on January 1st, 2016. The scientific objectives of IRIF are at the core of computer science and, in particular, they focus on the conception, analysis, proof, and verification of algorithms, programs, and programming languages. They are built upon fundamental research activities developed at IRIF on combinatorics, graphs, logics, automata, type, semantics, and algebras.\\

At the CNRS, IRIF is primarily affiliated to the Institute of Computer Science (INS2I), and, secondarily, to the Institute of Mathematics (INSMI). IRIF is part of the Department of Computer Science of the University Paris-Diderot, and also hosts several members of the Department of Mathematics. Last, IRIF is affiliated to the doctoral school of Mathematical Sciences of Paris (ED 386).\\ 

IRIF is structured in nine thematic teams, grouped into three research poles: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Pole Algorithms and discrete structures:

\begin{itemize}
\item Algorithms and complexity
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Combinatorics
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Complex Systems, Networks, and Distributed Computing 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Theory and algorithmics of graphs 
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Pole Automata, structures and verification:

\begin{itemize}
\item Automata and applications
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Modeling and verification
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Pole Proofs, programs and systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Algebra and computation
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis and conception of systems 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Proofs and programs
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
IRIF hosts currently a hundred permanent members), including roughly 54 faculty members, 30 CNRS researchers, 6 INRIA researchers and 5 administrative and technical staffs (in January 2018). The total number of IRIF members, including PhD students, post-docs, and long-term visitors amounts for about two hundred. \\

I've done my internship the the ``modeling and verification'' team, which studies and develops methods and tools for the software verification.

\subsection{Motivation}

les allocateurs sont des programmes petits mais tres difficiles à mettre au point car ils appellent des primitives de programmation complexes: arithmetiques de pointeur, operations bit à bit, appels aux systeme (pour etendre la memoire du processus). De plus, les structures de données sont assez complexes: heap-listes (chnamps next obtenu avec arithmetique de pointeur), listes doublement chainées, circulaires, arbres binaires de rechrche, table de hashage. 

Pour mettre au point ce programmes, des techniques de verification formelles ont été developpées. Ces techniques sont basées sur des logiques de programmes (logique de Hoare). Mon travail a fournit des programmes de test de ces techniques.


Dans mon stage j'ai mis au point ces allocateurs en utilisant du test unitaire et la  bibliotheque CUNIT.
